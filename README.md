# IT Time Sheet Automation

This application helps automate the process of submitting your IT time sheet by extracting data from OpenClock or Google Calendar and automatically filling it into the Self-Service portal.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)
- Google Calendar API credentials (for Google Calendar integration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SRshohan/IT_TimeSheet.git
cd IT_TimeSheet
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download ChromeDriver:
   - Visit [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   - Download the version that matches your Chrome browser version
   - Extract the chromedriver executable to the `chromedriver-mac-arm64` directory in the project root

5. Set up Google Calendar API (for Google Calendar integration):
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Download the credentials and save as `credentials.json` in the project root
   - Create a `.env` file and add your `CALENDAR_ID`
   - To find your Calendar ID:
     1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
     2. Click on the three dots (â‹®) next to your calendar name in the left sidebar
     3. Select "Settings and sharing"
     4. Scroll down to "Integrate calendar"
     5. Copy the "Calendar ID" (it usually looks like `example@gmail.com` or `example@group.calendar.google.com`)
     6. Add it to your `.env` file as `CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id`

## Usage

3. Enter your credentials in the sidebar
4. Select the date range for time sheet extraction
5. Choose your data source (OpenClock or Google Calendar)

## Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter ChromeDriver issues:
   - Ensure ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version
   - Verify ChromeDriver is in the correct directory
   - Check if ChromeDriver has executable permissions

2. If the application fails to connect:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if your credentials are correct
   - Ensure you have access to both OpenClock and Self-Service portals

3. For Google Calendar integration issues:
   - Verify your `credentials.json` is properly set up
   - Check if your `CALENDAR_ID` is correct in the `.env` file
   - Ensure you have granted necessary permissions to the application

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or share your credentials
- The application stores credentials only in your local session
- All data is processed locally on your machine
- Google Calendar credentials are stored securely and only used for API access
